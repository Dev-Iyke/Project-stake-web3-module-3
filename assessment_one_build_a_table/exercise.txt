Build a table
An HTML table is built with the following tag structure:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>name</th>
    <th>height</th>
    <th>place</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Kilimanjaro</td>
    <td>5895</td>
    <td>Tanzania</td>
  </tr>
</table>
For each row, the <table> tag contains a <tr> tag. Inside of these <tr> tags, we can put cell elements: either heading cells (<th>) or regular cells (<td>).

Given a dataset of mountains, an array of objects with name, height, and place properties, generate the DOM structure for a table that enumerates the objects. It has one column per key and one row per object, plus a header row with <th> elements at the top, listing the column names.

Write this so that the columns are automatically derived from the objects, by taking the property names of the first object in the data.

Show the resulting table in the document by appending it to the element that has an id attribute of "mountains".

Once you have this working, right-align cells that contain number values by setting their style.textAlign property to "right".
